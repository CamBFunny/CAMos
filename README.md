# CAMos
Computer-and-Man Operating System: Process as one.

## Purpose
A simple operating system with a human ALU.

## Slogan
# Harness electricity to chisel metal.

## Mission Statement
CAMos implementation will return technology to the age where computers were tools and man solved logic.

## Background
In the early days of the information era, running a computer consumed immense amounts of energy. This forced users to put in hours of preperation and debugging before attempting to run the code.
Due to the low power demands and modern processing speeds, computers around the world are doing billions of unecessary calculations every second. Processors are even thinking like humans, but can a human think like a processor?
CAMos inspires the user to solve problems as if they are the Arithmetic Logic Unit. Each input will be intentional and the GUI will provide immediate results.

# Future Plans
RusticOS, a rust-based GUI for CAMos on desktop.
